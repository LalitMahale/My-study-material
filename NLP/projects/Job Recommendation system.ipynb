    "We had **100k candidate** rusumes and **10k of job** are on our portal but candidate were facing deficulty to find the perfect job for them and in other hand Hr was had difficuty to find right candidate so in recommendation system we are recommending job to candidate and candidate to HR. \n"

    "\n",
    "**step 1 :** first works is to clearn the skills like HTML and HTML5 both almost same only it is updated version of html and some candidate were mensioned html and some html5 similary cpp and c++ so we have creaed a dictionary to convert in one format.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**step 2 :** convert all skills into vectors using word2vec and storing them in mysql in front of that candidate. similary when HR will add job description we were seperating skills and converting into vectors then storing into database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**step 3 :** so seperate the candidate by industry wise similary seperate job according to indusry now do similarity search for each indusry and reranking and give show the candidate. \n",
    "eg. if some one who is from machanical industry we will do similarity search on only mechanical industry job. \n",
    "\n",
    "**step 4:** Apply filter of experience which is mension in job description or candidate mension on portal \n",
    "for candidate if he has 3 year experience show job equal to or less than equal to his experince and for hr greater than or equal to so they can meet their criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "_________\n",
    "**For live recommendation for those who just registred so**\n",
    "once they create account immedieately we create vector once is submit form then we already have jobs vector for that indusry and apply experience filter and show the jobs.\n"
