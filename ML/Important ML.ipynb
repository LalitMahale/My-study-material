    "## Difference between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supervised learning is used when we have **label data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  eg. salary of an employee , pass or failed, Negative and positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning used when we have **unlabed data**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   eg. we have candidate data where we have only skills but not their field (it student, mechanical student)\n",
    "\n",

    "## How is KNN different from k-means?\n",
    "1. \n",
    "- KNN (K- nearest neighbour) is a **Supervised** Machine Learning Algorithm\n",
    "- k- mean is a **Unsupervised** Machine Learning Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- KNN used for **Classification Problem**\n",
    "- K-mean used for **unlabed data** and mainly for **this is clustering method**\n",

    "## What is the trade-off between bias and variance?\n",
    "**Bias** and **variance** are two important concepts in machine learning that help us understand the sources of error in predictive models:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias\n",
    "- **Definition**: Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which may be complex, with a simplified model.\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: \n",
    "  - High bias can lead to underfitting, where the model is too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "  - Models with high bias often make strong assumptions and are less flexible.\n",
    "- **Example**: A linear model trying to fit a highly nonlinear relationship may show high bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variance\n",
    "- **Definition**: Variance refers to the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data. It measures how much the model's predictions would change if it were trained on a different dataset.\n",
    "- **Characteristics**: \n",
    "  - High variance can lead to overfitting, where the model captures noise in the training data rather than the true underlying patterns.\n",
    "  - Models with high variance are often very complex and flexible.\n",
    "- **Example**: A decision tree that perfectly fits the training data, capturing every detail, may have high variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "- The goal in machine learning is to find a balance between bias and variance to minimize the total error:\n",
    "  - **Low Bias, High Variance**: The model is complex and fits the training data well but may perform poorly on unseen data.\n",
    "  - **High Bias, Low Variance**: The model is too simple and may not perform well on either training or test data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Finding the right model complexity is crucial to achieving a good generalization on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do classification and regression differ?\n",
    "1.\n",
    "- Classification used to predict the classes like pass or failed, Positive or ngegative\n",
    "- Regression used to predict continuous values like salary of employees , Quantity of an product or price of product\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\n",
    "-\n",
    "-\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\n",
    "-\n",
    "-\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the common ways to handle missing data in a dataset?\n",
    "- First **Delete the rows which contain missing Values**\n",
    "- If it is not possible to remove than fill with **Mean / Median / Mode**\n",
    "- Use algorith which support missing values eg . **Decision Tree or Random Forest**\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Bagging and Boosting?\n",
    "- Bagging is a ensemble learning which is used for improving unstable estimation or classification scheme\n",
    "- Boosting used to reduce the bias of the combined models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regularization \n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is used to address **overfitting problems** as it penalizes the loss function by adding a multiple of an L1 (LASSO) or an L2 (Ridge) norm of weights vector w."
